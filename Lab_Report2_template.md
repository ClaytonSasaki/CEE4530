2. Create a graph of absorbance at 660 nm vs. concentration of methylene blue in Atom using the exported data file. Does absorbance at 660 nm increase linearly with concentration of methylene blue?

```python
# import your file
from aide_design.play import*

import os

path = r'/Users/Clayton/github/My_CEE4530/CEE4530_Lab1_crs326.csv'
with open(path, 'rb') as csvfile:

data = pd.read_csv('CEE4530_Lab1_crs326.csv')
data = np.array(data)
print(data)

## do your data analysis here
## How to make an array?
#  x = [1,2,3,4,5]
# python starts at index 0
# x[2] = 3
# you can multiply an array with units
# y = [4,5,6] * u.mg/u.L
## 2-D Arrays
# z = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
# z[1,2] = 5
# z[2,:] = [7,8,9]

## plotting
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(concentration,absorbance)
# put in your x and y variables
plt.xlabel('Methylene Blue concentration', fontsize=15)
plt.ylabel('Absorbance', fontsize=15)
plt.show()
```

3. Plot $\epsilon$ as a function of wavelength for each of the standards on a single graph. Note that the path length is 1 cm. Make sure you include units and axis labels on your graph. If Beer’s law is obeyed what should the graph look like?
```python
b = 1 * u.cm
## Multiplication of Arrays
# you can multiply and divide arrays by constants!
# x = [1,2]
# y = 3
# z = 4
# a = x/z
# a = [0.25,0.5]
# b = x*y
# b = [3,6]
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(wavelength,epsilon_1)
# put in your x and y variables
plt.plot(wavelength,epsilon_2)
# put in your x and y variables
plt.plot(wavelength,epsilon_3)
# put in your x and y variables
plt.plot(wavelength,epsilon_4)
# put in your x and y variables
plt.plot(wavelength,epsilon_5)
# put in your x and y variables
plt.xlabel('Wavelength (nm)', fontsize=15)
plt.ylabel('Extinction coefficients', fontsize=15)
plt.show()
```

Your answer to the question here

4. Did you use interpolation or extrapolation to get the concentration of the unknown?
5. What colors of light are most strongly absorbed by methylene blue?
6. What measurement controls the accuracy of the density measurement for the NaCl solution? What density did you expect (see prelab 2)? Approximately what should the accuracy be?
7. Don’t forget to write a brief paragraph on conclusions and on suggestions using Markdown.
8. Verify that your report and graphs meet the requirements as outlined in the course materials.
